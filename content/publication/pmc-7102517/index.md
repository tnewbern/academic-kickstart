abstract: " Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 is still active in Wuhan, China, and is spreading to the rest of the world. Recently, perioperative anesthetic management in patients with suspected or confirmed coronavirus-2 has been reported. However, little has been reported on the anesthetic management of patients undergoing aortic dissection repair in patients with suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection. During the outbreak in Wuhan, the authorsâ€™ team completed 4 cases of aortic dissection repair successfully in patients with suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection. The purpose of the present report is to summarize current knowledge and experiences on anesthetic management in this patient population and to provide clinical practice guidelines on anesthetic management and infection prevention and control in these critically ill patients.
