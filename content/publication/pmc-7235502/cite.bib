Abstract
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) is a new coronavirus responsible for the pandemic named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19). The disease causes SARS with a significant morbidity and mortality. We provide a review with a focus on COVID‐19 in dermatology. We discuss triage of suspected infectious patients, protection of medical doctors and nurses. We discuss the available data on cutaneous symptoms, although disease‐specific symptoms have yet not been observed. COVID‐19 is a challenge for the treatment of dermatologic patients, either with severe inflammatory disorders or with skin cancer. The consequences for systemic treatment are obvious but it will be most important to collect the clinical data for a better decision process. Last but not least, education in dermatology for students will not be temporarily possible in the classical settings. COVID‐19, although not a skin disease, by itself has an immense impact on dermatology.
