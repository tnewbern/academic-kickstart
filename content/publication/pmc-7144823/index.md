abstract: " Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has spread across the globe resulting in a pandemic. At the time of this review, COVID-19 has been diagnosed in more than 200 000 patients and associated with over 8000 deaths (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, World Health Organization). On behalf of the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists, we herein summarize the current evidence as of March 18, 2020 to provide guidance on potential COVID-19 treatment options. It is important to caution readers that new data emerges daily regarding clinical characteristics, treatment options, and outcomes for COVID-19. Optimized supportive care remains the mainstay of therapy, and the clinical efficacy for the subsequent agents is still under investigation. Antimicrobial stewardship programs, including infectious diseases pharmacists and physicians, are at the forefront of COVID-19 emergency preparedness. We encourage all readers to continue to assess clinical data as it emerges and share their experience within our community in a well-controlled, adequately powered fashion. "
