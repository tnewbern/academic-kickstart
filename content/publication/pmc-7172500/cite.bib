Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a newly emerging human
infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, previously called 2019-nCoV). Based
on the rapid increase in the rate of human infection, the World
Health Organization (WHO) has classified the COVID-19 outbreak
as a pandemic. Because no specific drugs or vaccines for
COVID-19 are yet available, early diagnosis and management are
crucial for containing the outbreak. Here, we report a
field-effect transistor (FET)-based biosensing device for
detecting SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples. The sensor was
produced by coating graphene sheets of the FET with a specific
antibody against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The performance of
the sensor was determined using antigen protein, cultured virus,
and nasopharyngeal swab specimens from COVID-19 patients. Our
FET device could detect the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein at
concentrations of 1 fg/mL in phosphate-buffered saline and 100
fg/mL clinical transport medium. In addition, the FET sensor
successfully detected SARS-CoV-2 in culture medium (limit of
detection [LOD]: 1.6 × 10\textsuperscript1 pfu/mL) and clinical
samples (LOD: 2.42 × 10\textsuperscript2 copies/mL). Thus, we
have successfully fabricated a promising FET biosensor for
SARS-CoV-2; our device is a highly sensitive immunological
diagnostic method for COVID-19 that requires no sample
pretreatment or labeling.
