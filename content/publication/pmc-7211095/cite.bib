Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) has become a pandemic disease globally. Although COVID-19 directly invades lungs, it also involves the nervous system. Therefore, patients with nervous system involvement as the presenting symptoms in the early stage of infection may easily be misdiagnosed and their treatment delayed. They become silent contagious sources or ‘virus spreaders’. In order to help neurologists to better understand the occurrence, development and prognosis, we have developed this consensus of prevention and management of COVID‐19. It can also assist other healthcare providers to be familiar with and recognise COVID-19 in their evaluation of patients in the clinic and hospital environment.
