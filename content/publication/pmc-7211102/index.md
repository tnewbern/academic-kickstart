abstract: " The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged and spread rapidly throughout the world. As of February 29, 2020, 79â€‰389 cases of COVID-19 have been reported, and the outbreak is linked to 2838 deaths. The population is generally susceptible to the disease, and differences in incubation periods after infection exist among individuals. These two aspects of COVID-19 pose significant challenges to pediatric orthopedic diagnosis and treatment. As a dedicated center for managing pediatric cases of SARS-CoV-2 in Shanghai, our hospital has mobilized all branches and departments to undertake joint actions for scientific prevention and control, precise countermeasure and comprehensive anti-epidemic efforts. Combined with our experience, we have consulted the relevant national regulations and the latest research advances and have formulated the prevention and control measures of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including outpatient, emergency, inpatient and surgical cares, for clinical practices of pediatric orthopedics according to the physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2. It may serve as practical references and recommendations for managing SARS-CoV-2 infection in other pediatric specialties and in other hospitals. "
